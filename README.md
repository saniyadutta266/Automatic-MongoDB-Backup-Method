This is simple aws lambda function that uses `mongodump` to backup mongodb Database. 

It zips the file and uploads it to an S3 bucket.

Use the following environment variables in your Lambda setup:

```
MONGO_URL = mongodb://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>
S3_PATH = <s3bucket>/<folder>/...etc
```
